# Cognizant Profiles Search API Controllers

This Spring Boot application powers a search API for consultant profiles. It imports profile data from Azure Blob Storage, stores it in an Azure SQL database, and provides search functionality based on section content.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure application.properties

Open application.properties and enter the creditials 
```bash
cd springboot-api/src/main/resources/application.properties
```
### 2. Build the Project

Use Maven to clean and package 
```bash
cd springboot-api/
mvn clean package 
```
This deletes the `target/` directory and all its contents, then compiles the project and packages it into a JAR file.

### 3. Run the JAR File

Navigate to the target folder and run the JAR:
```bash
cd springboot-api/target
java -jar capstone-profile-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### 4. Access the API
Once running, the API should now be running on http://localhost:8080.
